        <h3>On your first day you will need to:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Find or create shelter</li>
            <li>Get something to eat</li>
            <li>Find something to drink</li>
            <li>Make a campfire</li>
        </ul> 

        <p> 
            A good idea once you first spawn in is to locate the shore. 
            Here you will find a surplus of sand blocks,
            a valuable source of glass and metal.
            Every block around you in the environment will drop varying important resources.
            Their drops can be viewed below.
